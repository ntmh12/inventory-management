# Inventory Management Dashboard

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive overview of inventory performance using ABC analysis and inventory KPIs. The dashboard enables business users to track stock levels, identify reorder needs, and optimize warehouse efficiency based on product value and demand patterns.

## 📌 Objectives

- Classify inventory using **ABC-XYZ analysis** based on value and demand variability.
- Monitor **inventory turnover**, stock status, and SKU-level performance.
- Identify **reorder priorities** and prevent stockouts or overstocking.
- Visualize **sales trends** and warehouse value over time.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop**: Interactive dashboards.
- **DAX**: Custom measures for inventory KPIs, ABC-XYZ classification, reorder logic.

## 📊 Key Features

- **ABC-XYZ Matrix**: Segment SKUs by value (A/B/C) and demand patterns (X/Y/Z).
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Measure of how efficiently inventory is used (average: 5.42).
- **Current Warehouse Value**: Visual overview of inventory worth (77.33M).
- **Stock Status Table**: Tracks individual SKU levels vs. reorder point and safety stock.
- **Reorder Alerts**: 284 SKUs flagged as needing replenishment.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Weekly sales visualization for operational planning.
- **Visual Distribution of ABC**: A column chart showing Avg. Cumulative Share of ABC-XYZ groups, helping identify high-priority SKUs.

## 📈 Business Insights

- High-value items (A-class) with uncertain demand (Z) show low turnover → risk of overstock.
- Most SKUs (89.7%) fall into "Below Safety Stock" or "Below Reorder Point" → supply chain gaps.  
- A small portion of SKUs contributes to the majority of revenue (Pareto pattern).
